modify the heightMap file to take in that buffer array as a constructor

then using said code create a LUA tool which uses the heightmap to generate a preprocessed buffer object for each RGB channel of the image, so it needs to load in an image from LUA

then after that tool has processed that data go and convert that buffer array
to LUA syntax and save that string literal to your output

then for interpretted on the roblox side simply paste it into a module script for each RGB channel and load in each RGB channel into their heightmap formats by passing the buffers they return as the constructors buffer argument

DO NOT FORM AN ARRAY WITH THEM (defeats purpose)

then for sampling simply do as you usually do for getting the x and y coordinate but instead of doing color3 you will need to sample each color value from them and then form a color3 with those.
